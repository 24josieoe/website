  <p class="b"> During my freshman year, the English department assigned a research paper. Because of my interest in psychology, I decided to write my paper on sociopaths. For a month, I read books, articles, and interviewed a forensic psychologist. This expanded my prior knowledge of personality disorders and childhood conduct disorder.

  <p class="b"> For my Joy of Computing final freshman year, I coded a game based around the TV show character: Peppa Pig. The game overall forces the user to complete certain tasks to complete the game. Most of this time I spent touble-shooting and planning. This really helped me develop my computing skills.
